{"query": "How far away can whales communicate with eachother?", "answer": ["Whales can communicate with each other over vast distances, potentially hundreds of kilometers[0]. They use a variety of vocalizations, including melodic calls, clicks, and low-frequency sounds, to convey messages[2].."], "source": [{"idx": 0, "title": "Whale", "paragraph": "Communication. Whale vocalization is likely to serve several purposes. Some species, such as the humpback whale, communicate using melodic sounds, known as whale song. These sounds may be extremely loud, depending on the species. Humpback whales only have been heard making clicks, while toothed whales use sonar that may generate up to 20,000 watts of sound (+73dBm or +43dBw) and be heard for many miles. Captive whales have occasionally been known to mimic human speech. Scientists have suggested this indicates a strong desire on behalf of the whales to communicate with humans, as whales have a very different vocal mechanism, so imitating human speech likely takes considerable effort. Whales emit two distinct kinds of acoustic signals, which are called whistles and clicks:"}, {"idx": 2, "title": "Cetacea", "paragraph": "Whale song. Males in some baleen species communicate via whale song, sequences of high pitched sounds. These \"songs\" can be heard for hundreds of kilometers. Each population generally shares a distinct song, which evolves over time. Sometimes, an individual can be identified by its distinctive vocals, such as the 52-hertz whale that sings at a higher frequency than other whales. Some individuals are capable of generating over 600 distinct sounds. In baleen species such as humpbacks, blues and fins, male-specific song is believed to be used to attract and display fitness to females."}]}
